# Introduction 
- This project is a development from a project that seniors have done in the past. We have seen the imperfections of the project. for example Translations that are not shown , Incomplete audio files, colors and pages of the web page are not interested.
So we want to continue this project to make this project more complete and add some functions.

# Problem Definition
- Almost all Muslims today are able to read the Quran. But there are also many people who read it and do not understand the meaning of the Qur'an, and there are many people who misread the Quran because they do not know the correct way of reading it.
